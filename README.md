# A Game Catalogue

## Application Details

The intended application is for gamers, or people who generally wish to organise their games.  This project is of 
interest to me because I like to keep track of what I've watched and read, and I wanted to organise my games in a 
similar way.  I like playing many video games, but I haven't seen a page or platform that allows you to organise 
both console and PC games like other websites that organise your movies, TV shows or books.

The application I'm making should allow the user to navigate on a simple digital catalogue for games;  Each game holds
basic details about it, such as its: title, genre(s), developer(s), platforms, publishing year and the user's gameplay 
status on that game.  I hope for the user to be able to view games through different filters, such as:
- All games
- Completed
- Currently playing
- Games on hold
- Plan to play
