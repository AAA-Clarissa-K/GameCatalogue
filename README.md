# My Personal Project

## A Game Catalogue

**What will the application do?**

It allows the user to navigate on a digital catalogue for games.  Clicking on each game should give you basic details
about it, such as its: title, genre(s), developer(s), platforms, publishing year and gameplay status.
I hope for them to be able to move games between
different folders/pages, for example:
- All games
- Completed
- Currently playing
- Games on hold
- Plan to play
- Favourites

The intended users are gamers, or generally people who wish to organise their games online. 

This project is of interest to me because I like to keep track of what I've watched and read.  I also like playing many 
video games, but I haven't seen a page or platform that allows you to organise both console and PC games.
